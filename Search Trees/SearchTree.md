## Points:
1. Iterator permits us to reference and enumerate the entries of the structure.
2. 





## Binary Search Tree
1. It's an excellent data structure to store the entries of a map;
2. A binary search tree is a binary tree T such that each internal node v of T stores an entry (k,x) such that:
3. (Keys stored at nodes in the left) <= k; (Keys stored at nodes in the right) >= k
4. We store entries only at the internal nodes. External nodes do not store entries
5. A binary seach tree can realize an ordered map/dictionary
6.
